# Nick's Quick Nix Tutorial

Created for my final project in COS 398: client side web development Fall 2023
at Umaine.

Visit live at [https://dieff.github.io/COS398-final/](https://dieff.github.io/COS398-final/)!

## Development

The easy way to get started is by using [Nix](https://nixos.org/) and [direnv](https://direnv.net/).

```
direnv allow
```

Nix is not a hard dependency (because I didn't want to use it with Github actions).
You can also run all build tools through NPM.

## Design

The focus of COS 398 is client side web development. The class focuses on static site development with HTML, SCSS, and Typescript.
