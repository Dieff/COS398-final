      h1 Making Your Own Desktop

      :markdown-it
        Any long-time Linux user will run into the idea of "dotfiles". Linux desktops are
        composed of many different pieces of software. Most of these programs are configured using
        a hidden test-based config file in `~` or `~/.config`. This is a dotfile. When you
        emerge from your getting-really-into-custom-unix phase, and find have hundreds of dotfiles
        to deal with, you start using tools to manage them all. Eventually, you end up with the
        classic dotfiles repository.

        Nix has made the dotfiles repository obsolete. Imagine a world where all of your software
        can be configured in the same language. Install packages at the same time you set them up.
        Easily deploy your super customized `vim` and `tmux` to another system. Roll back to an old

      h2 Home Manager
      h2 Basic Wayland Flake

      :markdown-it
        Although you can use any number of software combinations when putting together a Linux
        desktop, this tutorial is going to offer some strong opinions about what to get with.
        Our whole purpose here is to try a new and different way of doing Linux. We will be using
        Home Manager to try out the latest in Linux Desktop tech, including:

        - Wayland
        - Containerized Applications
        - Pirewire
        - Systemd


        The following are some examples of NixOS + Home Manager configurations from around the net. All
        code is licensed for open source use. Feel free to use them for examples and inspiration.
